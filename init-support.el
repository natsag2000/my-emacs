  "Emacs Lisp doesn’t come with a ‘filter’ function to keep
    elements that satisfy a conditional and excise the elements that
    do not satisfy it. One can use ‘mapcar’ to iterate over a list
    with a conditional, and then use ‘delq’ to remove the ‘nil’
    values."

;;; Curry and Compose
;;

;; I like this [[https://gist.github.com/eschulte/6167923][Eric Schulte's 'curry' functions]]. Allows for more
;;   compact anonymous functions. The following examples demonstrate the
;;   usage.

;; partial application with `curry'
;; (mapcar (» #'+ 2) '(1 2 3 4)) ; => (3 4 5 6)

;; ;; alternate order of arguments with `rcurry'
;; (mapcar (« #'- 1) '(1 2 3 4)) ; => (0 1 2 3)

;; ;; function composition with `compose'
;; (mapcar (∘ #'list (» #'* 2)) '(1 2 3 4)) ; => ((2) (4) (6) (8))


;;First, define the =curry= function:
(defsubst curry (function &rest arguments)
  (lexical-let ((function function)
                (arguments arguments))
    (lambda (&rest more) (apply function (append arguments more)))))

;;And the right-oriented =rcurry= function:
(defsubst rcurry (function &rest arguments)
  (lexical-let ((function function)
                (arguments arguments))
    (lambda (&rest more) (apply function (append more arguments)))))

;;And the =compose= function that can accept a number of functions:
(defsubst compose (function &rest more-functions)
  (cl-reduce (lambda (f g)
               (lexical-let ((f f) (g g))
                 (lambda (&rest arguments)
                   (funcall f (apply g arguments)))))))

;;; Key Sequences
;;

;; As I wrote in [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/lists-and-key-sequences.html][key sequences essay]], the following macro makes it
;;   trivial to create a key sequence, like what I have in [[file:emacs-client.org::*Color%20Theme][emacs-client]]
;;   initialization file.
(defmacro define-sequence (map-name prefix func seqs)
  "Define a collection of key sequences associated with MAP-NAME
    and begin with PREFIX that call a function, FUNC.  The SEQS is a
    list where each element is a list that begins with a final key
    binding. The rest of the list is given as parameters to the
    function, FUNC."
  `(progn
     (define-prefix-command ,map-name)
     (global-set-key (kbd ,prefix) ,map-name)
     (dolist (el ,seqs)
       (lexical-let ((keystroke (car el))
                     (the-rest  (cdr el)))
         (define-key ,map-name (kbd keystroke)
           (lambda ()
             (interactive)
             (apply ,func the-rest)))))))
